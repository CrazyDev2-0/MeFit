## Guide to run in local system
### Steps to run backend
- Clone the [backend]("./backend") folder
- Clone .env-example file and rename it to .env
- Fill the values .env with appropiate values
- If you are adding new database, run `npm run dbMigrate` and `npm run dbDeploy`
- Start core backend service by running `npm run start`
- Start consumer process by running `node start_consumer.js`
- Start job scheduler by running `start_jobs.js`

### Steps to run Doctor Admin Panel
- Clone the [doctor_admin_panel]("./doctor_admin_panel") folder
- Update *BASE_URL* with your deployed link of backend in project
- Run `npm start` or build by `npm run build`

### Steps to build Android App
- Clone the [mefit_android_app App]("./mefit_android_app") folder
- Go to `lib/config/config.dart` file and update `baseDomain` with deployed  url of backend
- To build apk file , run `flutter build apk --release`

### Steps to run ML Models as a microservice
- Clone the  [ml_models]("./ml_models") folder 
- For each subfolder there will be an `predict.py` file [*also there can be an `train.py` file*] .
- In main section of each file , update the rabbitmq username, rabbitmq password, rabbitmq url, rabbitmq vhost and backend url
- To start the microservice run `python predict.py` or `python train.py`

### Steps to run Health Simulator
- Clone the [health_simulator]("./health_simulator") folder
- To compiler or run , QT vesion>=6.0.0 need to be installed in local system
- You can open the project with QT editor and run/build directly from IDE

### Steps to install code in Nodemcu [Hardware]
- Clone the [hardware_codebase]("./hardware_codebase") folder
- Open `code.ino` folder in Arduino IDE
- Update `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`
- Update `hardware_id` with random number
- Connect `Nodemcu v1.0` to Arduino IDE
- Clik on `Upload`
